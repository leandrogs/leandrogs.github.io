I'm an experienced engineer working over 5 years with Ruby (Ruby on Rails) and Python, always adopting good practices (TDD, Clean Code, Clean Architecture).

I'm data-driven. I need to know the metrics that raised a flag about a problem and I also monitor the impact of a given solution to that problem.
